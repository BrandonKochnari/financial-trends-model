# Project Structure
# Python Version: 3.9
# Packages Required: numpy, matplotlib

# Project Main Concept
# Objective: Imitate stock movement in the stock market
# Pre-planning:
#   - Method: Apply distribution to create a probability distribution function with range
#   - Desired Outcome: A general trend should be discovered if sample size is increased
#   - Varying Factors:
#       - s_i: the initial value of the stock(s)
#       - sd: standard deviation (volatility of stock)
#       - mu(Âµ): average rate of increase over 11 months
#       - dt (delta time): domain / number of experiments to be conducted
#       - trials: the number of trials to be conducted overall and recorded


# Execution
